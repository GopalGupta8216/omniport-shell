# Shell

> The default models in Kernel are perfectly fine and good to go, but at times you need a little customisation here and a little customisation there.

Enter Shell, the app where you write customised implementations of the abstract models defined in Kernel and then use swapper to replace the Kernel implementations with your own.

Drop this in your project folder and like everything else, Omniport will automatically discover it, pick it up and absorb it.
