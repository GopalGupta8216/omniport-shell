# Shell

## IIT Roorkee

> The default models in `core.kernel` are perfectly fine and good to go, but at times you need a little customisation here and a little customisation there.

Enter `shell`, the app where you write customised implementations of the abstract models defined in `kernel` and then use swapper to replace the `kernel` implementations with your own.

Drop this in your project folder and like everything else, Omniport will automatically discover it, pick it up and absorb it.
